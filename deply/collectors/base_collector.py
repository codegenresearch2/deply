from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class BaseCollector(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def match_in_file(self, file_path: Path) -> set[CodeElement]:
        pass

    def collect(self, paths: List[str], exclude_files: List[str]) -> set[CodeElement]:

        for path in paths:

I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code snippet.

1. I have removed the unused imports `get_import_aliases`, `get_base_name`, and `re` to streamline the code.
2. I have removed the `__init__` method and the `_load_file_asts` method from the class structure, as they are not essential for the functionality being implemented.
3. I have updated the return type of the `match_in_file` method to match the gold code's syntax.
4. I have focused on defining only the abstract method `match_in_file` to align with the gold code.

Here is the updated code snippet:


from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List
from deply.models.code_element import CodeElement

class BaseCollector(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def match_in_file(self, file_path: Path) -> set[CodeElement]:
        pass

    def collect(self, paths: List[str], exclude_files: List[str]) -> set[CodeElement]:
        collected_elements = set()
        for path in paths:
            if path not in exclude_files:
                collected_elements.update(self.match_in_file(Path(path)))
        return collected_elements


This updated code snippet addresses the test case feedback by removing the invalid comment and aligns more closely with the gold code snippet by simplifying the class structure, removing unused imports, and ensuring the return type matches the syntax.
